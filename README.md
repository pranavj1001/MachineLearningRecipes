Machine Learning Recipes ðŸ˜‡ Datasets used here are available at Kaggle

Hey there,

This repo contains various machine learning scripts which I've used on datasets which can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). I've used many algorithms. More details are given below

## Contents

1. **Iris**: This is the classic dataset which almost every beginner in ML knows about. Here, the aim is to classify the flower species. Two scripts are added using K-Nearest-Neighbors and Naive Bayes. Required Data to predict SepalLength in cm, SepalWidth in cm, PetalLength in cm, PetalWidth in cm.

2. **Pokemon**: This dataset contains details of many Pokemons. Here, the aim is to classify a Pokemon as legendary or not-legendary. Two scripts are added using K-Nearest-Neighbors and Support Vector Machines. Required Data to predict Hit Points, Attack Points, Defence Points, Special Attack Points, Special Defence Points, Speed Points.

3. **Mushrooms**: This dataset contains details of many Mushrooms. Here, the aim to classify a Mushroom as poisonous or edible. Two scripts are added using K-Nearest-Neighbors and Naive Bayes. Details about required data is mentioned in the program itself.

4. **Restaurant Reviews**: This dataset contains many reviews about a restaurant. Here, the aim is to classify a restaurant review as good or bad. Two scripts are added using Naive Bayes and Random Forest. It uses nltk to clean the text and CountVectorizer to create bag of words model. Required data is just the review.

5. **Churn Model**: This dataset contains details about bank employees. Here, the aim is predict whether a customer will leave bank's service or not. It uses artificial neural network to do the job. Also, keras is used here. Details about required data is mentioned in the program itself.
