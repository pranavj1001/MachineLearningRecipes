# SQL Scanvenger Hunt Day 2

Hey there,

The questions for Day2 are:

1. How many stories (use the "id" column) are there of each type (in the "type" column) in the full table?

2. How many comments have been deleted? (If a comment was deleted the "deleted" column in the comments table will have the value "True".)

3. Optional extra credit: read about aggregate functions other than COUNT() and modify one of the queries you wrote above to use a different aggregate function.
