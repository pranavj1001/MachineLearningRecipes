## Red Wine Quality

Hey there, 

The dataset here contains details about red wines. It has various parameters to judge a wine from. It also has a **Quality** column which is based on the other columns. There are in total 1600 rows.

So, here using **Multiple Linear Regression** I've tried to predict quality of red wine. Then, using **Backward Elimination** I've built an optimal model and thereby took out some columns which are not necessary.

## Selected Columns

- [ ] Fixed acidity
- [x] Volatile acidity
- [ ] Citric acid
- [ ] Residual sugar
- [x] Chlorides
- [ ] Free sulphur dioxide
- [x] Total sulphur dioxide
- [ ] Density
- [x] pH
- [x] Sulphates
- [x] Alcohol

**Note**: I've considered p-value < 0.05
